Installation
============

``herakoi`` runs on python 3. To check whether you have already a working python build, you can try typing ``python3 --version``. If you get a message like ``Python 3.XX.YY`` (with ``XX`` and ``YY`` on the specific version), then you are ready to go!

The stable release of ``herakoi`` can be installed through `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ simply as

  python -m pip install herakoi

If you feel adventurous, you can instead give a try to the dev release as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/lucadimascolo/herakoi.git

  cd herakoi
  
  python -m pip install e .
