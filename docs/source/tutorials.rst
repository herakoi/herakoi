Quickstart
----------

First and foremost, ``herakoi`` works by sending sound information to an external software via MIDI messages. As such, before starting a sonification session, you should open a MIDI player (for example, GarageBand, LMMS, or any online player as Soundtrap) and select your favorite virtual instrument.

If ``herakoi`` was installed successfully, you should be able to run a sonification session by simply running the command ``herakoi`` from the terminal. This will open a browser window from which you can select the image you would like to sonify.

Alternatively, you can define the path to your image as

.. code-block:: bash

   herakoi <path-to-your-image>

You should now see a new window showing the selected image as well as the video captured by the webcam. The MIDI player should automatically recognize ``herakoi`` as an external MIDI instrument and be immediately able to generate sound.
